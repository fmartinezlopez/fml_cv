			I have been acting as mentor and offering support to junior students. I have supported new PhD students in the Queen Mary neutrino group, helping them with both university-related and technical problems. Also, during my stay at CERN, I mentored a M.Sc. student working on DUNE DAQ. We had meetings every month to advise them on their project. Similarly, I have supported undergraduate students working on DUNE ND-GAr projects at Queen Mary.

			I was demonstrating for the module, in a class of 30 undergraduate students, 4 hours of class per week during 11 weeks. I helped the students with their coding assessments and any other queries about the module and its contents. Additionally, I assessed their work, checking the state and quality of their code, as well as their theory knowledge.
